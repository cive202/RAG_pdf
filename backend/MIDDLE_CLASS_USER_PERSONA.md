## User Quote

### Nepali (Natural):
> "Ma Anupama Sangraula ho, CA hun. Mero ghar ko combined income 1.1 lakh cha mahina ko, tara expense pani dherai cha. Mero 5 barsa ko chora cha, usko education ko lagi kati chahiyo, kati save garna parcha, yo thaha chaina. Maile gold ma 2 lakh rakhya, mutual fund ma 80 hajar, FD ma 1.2 lakh, tara kati return aaucha, kati badhcha, yo clear chaina. Emergency fund chahiyo, tara kati chahiyo, kati mahina ko, yo thaha chaina. Gold lekhda ramro ki mutual fund, yo confusion cha. Maile Khalti, eSewa use garchu daily, tara finance track garna garo cha. Yedi mero sajilo app banauna milcha, jasma maile Nepali ma advice pauchu, simple language ma, ani screenshot bata data halna milcha - ma 499/month tirchu. Tara yo trustworthy hunuparcha, safe hunuparcha, maile mero paisa ko barema kura garna manlagcha."

### English Translation:
> "I'm Anupama Sangraula, a CA. My household combined income is 1.1 lakhs per month, but expenses are also high. I have a 5-year-old son, I don't know how much is needed for his education, how much to save. I've kept 2 lakhs in gold, 80 thousand in mutual funds, 1.2 lakhs in FD, but I don't know what returns I'll get, how much it will grow. I need an emergency fund, but don't know how much, for how many months. There's confusion about whether gold is better or mutual funds. I use Khalti, eSewa daily, but tracking finances is difficult. If you can build a simple app where I get advice in Nepali, in simple language, and can enter data via screenshots - I'll pay 499/month. But it must be trustworthy, safe, I want to talk about my money."

## Mode Preference: Manual (60%) + Screenshot/Semi-Auto (40%)

### Manual Mode (60% usage)

**When:**
- End of month expense review
- Before making investment decisions
- Planning for festivals
- Quarterly financial checkup

**What she does:**
- Manually enters income (her salary + husband's variable income)
- Categorizes expenses from memory/receipts
- Enters investment amounts manually
- Checks bank statements and enters data
- Calculates savings rate manually

**Why Manual:**
- Wants control and understanding
- Doesn't trust auto-sync completely
- Feels more secure entering data herself
- Educational - learns by doing

**Pain:** Takes 1-2 hours, sometimes forgets entries, calculations can be wrong

---

### Screenshot/Semi-Auto Mode (40% usage)

**When:**
- Quick weekly check-ins
- After receiving salary
- When checking Khalti/eSewa balance
- Before festival shopping

**What she does:**
- Takes screenshots of Khalti/eSewa transactions
- Uploads bank statement screenshots
- App auto-extracts amounts and categories
- Reviews and confirms auto-categorized expenses
- Gets suggestions based on spending patterns

**Why Semi-Auto:**
- Saves time on data entry
- Still feels in control (can review/edit)
- Trusts screenshot more than full auto-sync
- Convenient for quick updates

**Pain:** Sometimes OCR misreads, needs manual correction

---

### Automatic Mode (0% - Not Preferred)

**Why Not:**
- Privacy concerns (doesn't want to connect bank accounts)
- Trust issues (worried about data security)
- Wants to understand where money goes (manual entry helps)
- Feels disconnected if fully automatic
