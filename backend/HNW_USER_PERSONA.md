### Nepali (Natural):
> "Ma Binod Chaudhary ho. Mero net worth ko exact calculation garna garo cha. Malai thaha cha maile kati property cha, kati share ma, kati gold ma, tara sabai jodera ekchoti herna manlagcha. Mero accountant le Excel ma rakheko cha, tara yo real-time chaina, prediction chaina. Maile land ko value badhiraheko cha, share portfolio fluctuate huncha, gold ko price badhiraheko cha - yo sabai ek thau ma dekhauna parcha. Ani mero bachcha haru lai kati inheritance dina milcha, tax kati lagcha, yo sab plan garna manlagcha.

Maile 1,999 tirchu monthly, tara yo sab automatic hunuparcha - maile haru mahina data halna manlagdaina."

### English Translation:
> "It's difficult to get an exact calculation of my net worth. I know how much I have in property, shares, gold, but I want to see everything combined in one place. My accountant keeps it in Excel, but it's not real-time, no predictions. My land values are increasing, share portfolio fluctuates, gold prices are rising - all this needs to be shown in one place. And I want to plan inheritance for my children - how much can I give them, how much tax will apply. Business income varies month to month, rental income is stable, but I need an overall net worth dashboard. I'll pay 1,999 monthly, but everything must be automatic - I don't want to enter data every month."
