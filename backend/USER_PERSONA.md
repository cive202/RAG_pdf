## User Quote

### Nepali (Natural):
> "Dai, ma Sanjog Koirala ho. Ma Upwork bata $2000 kamauchu, YouTube bata 15k, ani mero startup le 20k dincha. Tara yo sab track garna ekdam garo cha. Maile FD ma 3 lakh rakhya, NEPSE ma 5 lakh cha, tara kati return aaucha, kati tax lagcha, yo thaha chaina. Meroshare ma dinbhari herirahane, tara strategy kei chaina. Ma 35 ko age ma 1 crore portfolio chahanchu, tara harek mahina ko income change huncha, expense pani change huncha. Yedi mero sajilo tracker banauna milcha, jasma maile exact prediction pauchu - kati mahina ma kati pugcha, tax kati lagcha, ani kati invest garna parcha - ma 999/month tirchu."

### English Translation:
> "Bro, I earn $2000 from Upwork, 15k from YouTube, and my startup gives me 20k. But tracking all this is really difficult. I've kept 3 lakhs in FD, 5 lakhs in NEPSE, but I don't know what returns I'll get, how much tax will apply. I check Meroshare all day, but there's no strategy. I want a 1 crore portfolio by age 35, but my income changes every month, expenses change too. If you can build a simple tracker where I get exact predictions - how many months to reach how much, how much tax, and how much to invest - I'll pay 999/month."
